    p QR codes are a link, instead of typing a website URL, all you have to do is have a scanner app on your smartphone and scan the code.  QR codes are everywhere.  Now that you know what a QR code is and what it can do, we guarantee you will notice them everywhere since they are becoming more prevalent every day. With these codes on your cardsly card you can give a person not only a physical card, but a link to a place on the web of your choosing.

    p Each Cardsly card can be individually tracked, so you can detect which card has been scanned and thus follow up on that specfic card. This is all done with real time tracking.
    p With the exact time and location follow ups to business cards have never been easier.

    img.update_interface(src='/images/cardeditor.png')
    p Each card cotains a unique code so that each card can link to a different place. With each order you set your default page for all of those cards, but each card can be changed to go to whatever specfic link you need, at anytime you want. It is all managed through the above interface. With Cardsly we give you full control over each code.
